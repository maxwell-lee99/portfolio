The task at hand is to create an implementation of the SON Algorithm using PySpark RDDs. Included in this repository is the code used to produce the results for the Ta Feng Dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/chiranjivdas09/ta-feng-grocery-dataset. The code was graded by its ability to generate the results with a filter threshold of 20 and a support of 50 in under 500 seconds. This assignment received full marks for meeting accuracy and time restrictions.
