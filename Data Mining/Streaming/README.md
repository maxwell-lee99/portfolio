This assignment simulates streaming data and three different scenarios you may encounter dealing with streaming. Blackbox simulates the stream. Bloom filtering is used to determine whether a user that enters the stream is unqiue. The Flajolet-Martin algorithm is used to estimate the number of unique users. Fixed size sampling is used to probabilistically maintain a representative sample of the data entering the stream.
