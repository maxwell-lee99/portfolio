This folder contains work done on USC's DSCI 553 Foundations and Applications of Data Mining. The purpose of the class is to understand and implement big data algorithms using PySpark. In general, we were only allowed to use PySpark RDDs, and were not allowed to use PySpark DataFrames. Inside each folder you will find the assignment description, a README file providing the basic overview of the assignment, and the code used to satisfy the requirements.
