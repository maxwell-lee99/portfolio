This project asked us to create our own project on any topic other than the spread of COVID (since we had already done a project on that). We decided to model traffic flow through an intersection. We provided a base case, then simulated three methods to increase the flow of traffic at the intersection. The file sensor.py provides the code we used to simulate the use of a traffic sensor to assign a green light to the busiest part of the intersection. The PDF is the large academic write up we were tasked to produce.
